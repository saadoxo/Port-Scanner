## üîç Simple TCP Port Scanner (Python 3)

This is a basic **TCP port scanner** built in Python 3. It allows you to scan a range of ports (in this case, **50‚Äì84**) on a specified target IP or hostname to check which ports are open.

---

###  How It Works

- Takes a **target IP address or hostname** as a command-line argument.
- Resolves the hostname to an IP (if necessary).
- Scans ports **50 to 84** using TCP connection attempts.
- Prints out any ports that respond as open.
